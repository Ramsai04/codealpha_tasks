## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* *HTML5:* Semantic structure for the calculator wrapper, display, and input keys.
* *CSS3:* Flexbox for centering, CSS Grid for the button layout, and Media Queries for responsive adjustments.
* *JavaScript (ES6):* Vanilla JavaScript for handling input capture, string evaluation, and backspace parsing.


## 📂 Code Architecture

* *screen(input)*: Appends the clicked button value directly to the calculator display.
* *scree()*: Evaluates the mathematical string expression securely inside a try...catch block using the eval() method.
* *clear1()*: Instantly resets and wipes the calculator display screen (AC).
* *back()*: Deletes the last entered character using string slicing, or clears out an active "Error" screen.
